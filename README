Harry Potter Couple Generator

This is just a fun project I did for my girlfriend. She's crazy about writing fanfics and Harry Potter, and I'd like to take the rust off of my little C++ knowledge.
It gets a random list of Harry Potter's characters and makes couples (heterosexual, homosexual - and more!) and is intended for fanfic writers. Don't take it seriously.
